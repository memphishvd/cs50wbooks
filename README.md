# Project 0
CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
A basic website on any topic using HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap 4

# Descripton:
    Since the project objective was to make me more comfortable with HTML/CSS/SCSS and Bootstrap 4, I have focused more on utilizing the techniques then the actual content of the website. For this reason the content has been kept basic however all the required techniques have been implemented. 

    The website is a high level overview of the CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript course at EDX.
